 The main idea of solving for depth using a stereo camera involves the concept of triangulation and stereo matching. The formal depends on good calibration and rectification to constrain the problem so that it can be model on a 2D plane known as the epipolar plane, which greatly reduces the latter to a line search along the epipolar line (fig 7).
